To any snip-snap feller
and my world revolves
She's my great joy, my ecstasy,
I could not believe you were gone. My palm kept
But when I come to the kings fair courte,
We looked among orchard trees and beyond
The lightest pledge which binds her love and life;
and backs covered with shining feathers
Future mother, wife and sister,
One day on a visit, she quizzed
You are the beautiful child we brought you on this world for reason
By those that are not entirely beautiful;
The sin upon his is one.
She has pretty parties with dolls as her mates
Let my memory still be thy pride,
My daughter’s new daughter
In veins of fire, and she laughed,
me in darkness and silence
All kind of dainties and delicates sweete
With letters and lovers for ever they vex us,
Now look my little angel your all grown
A fool to snap my lily.
By the topmost stair! When the ill-bred lovers come
In your little imperious eyes;
How can one spend a life time with one man?
And knew not of my hopeless prayer,
What Bosom, but Devotion's Ardor feels,
and life is to be lived?
Away from you
Your Mother lives inside your laughter.
P'r'aps some Princess's son -
She interrupted
Shall I woo the one or other?
she’s behind you at the table,
Don`t pluck these flowers,
A tattered coolie who was born in a leap year that comes home after a strenuous day's work?
'My bonny Sir Hew, my pretty Sir Hew,
Everything you do is full of flowers, rich with the earth.
And to possess them, honoured Margaret.
Always remember who you are
And Maud sings wildly now;
For never summer sun nor gale
Father and daughter enjoy each other's company
I was the tree…you were the strong branch
Golden gifts for all the rest,
We have so much

and gloom of the cold winter is almost over.
Happiness is silent, or speaks equivocally for friends,
And never change,
A trip to town, to buy a new gown,
on average, they are only
a feeling I now have
my mind's eye sewn shut
are a bird with claws
If a happy man can be wise,
Do they within their wall, happiness hold
What now to guide my dreams?
Knowing each other so well that reacting becomes instinctive.
Like kisses, soon all joys are gone.
Where is happiness?
If I am miserable and full of fear.
She’s afraid to show herself to everyone,
a thing everyone needs to find
One fine day.
It takes its toll on my family
Some of us are in search of a world of perceptual bliss
Never lost to furies of a purple storm.

No nestling place is left in bluebell bloom,
This is true happiness.
When a soulmate is near!
All that i want you to know
I saw you passing by, I told you why the love
A quiet night of deep restful sleep.
That happiness is what you do
Happy is he who peace has found

Gaily round my sparkling smiles
It's not because all my memories are painful,

Forgiveness is noble.
Happiness is that which rights all wrongs
And yet they still hold true.

So let's just hope when it finally comes it will never go away
That's if our love don't reject

Without delay, I am prepared to make this enemy into my prey.
Tainted moments of surreal mid winter.

The enemy camp was only a short five-click hike away.

And aye beside her stalks her amorous knight !
I put a rose every day on the wall of your house
Thinking of you, I look at heavens and all I see is blue,
It transcends all pines, all wines, all loftiness,
The field where she was coyly cuddling her pet,
The message is spread with split offers
I adore outdoor action

I wonder what impulse drives me: Do I walk
Of a romantic,
Hoping one day
And go on the dark side of moral
As we engage in this overwhelming love making
Every sentiment uttered for the beloved, seems exaggerated.
Say about adventures of lovers
They grow too bright to be.
Love is ridiculous.
The opportunity to love is common to all.
Romance is thefirst free thing in life
A wanting to be held.
Because adventure is the spice and taste of romantic life here;
guess what were they thinking
and you.

For, with love comes all virtues to one in life
What do I dread?
To the catch in your throat
Of a millionaire,
that washed out all selfish sorrow,
Listen to my sweet song and
And think it doesn't matter
My heart overflows
In the absence of her,
Those deep romantic moments,
And betraying him

An amorous dusk it was

It's that Romantic Feeling,
Of faithful Love hath caged in iron schemes,
Ignoring a few painful casual strife,
when war is no more and
bad boys will break desolate hearts
Isn't it,

That creeps through the high gray plain,
Round the lone house in the midst of the corn,
'Twixt every page my thoughts go stray at large
Some people show off the beauty of their face
A shelter from the sky.

With every little quiver.
Some live for a short,

To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,
